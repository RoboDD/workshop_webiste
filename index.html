  <h4>
<br>
Despite significant recent advances, planning remains a fundamentally hard problem, especially when considering applications to long-horizon tasks and with sparse feedback.
<b>Abstraction</b> is one of the main tools we as researchers have to address these challenges.
<b>State abstraction</b> allows agents to focus on the important aspects of a planning problem, and <b>action abstraction</b> allows agents to reason across long horizons.
These principles have been used to great effect in many different subfields of AI and in many different forms, such as robotics, embodied AI, and reinforcement learning.
<br><br>
Humans own a special ability to design abstractions for their own use. However, designing abstractions by hand is labor-intensive and difficult: even for an expert, it is difficult to anticipate the influence of the abstraction on downstream planning performance.
This motivates an important research question that has attracted significant research attraction.
<br><br>
The goal of this workshop is to elucidate the key questions that must be answered when learning abstractions for planning and to suggest some possible answers.
For this to succeed, we will need to establish a common understanding of <b>abstraction</b> in the context of planning.
This will require bridge-building between different sub-disciplines, which we will facilitate in two ways: (1) a diverse selection of papers and invited speakers; and (2) a highly interactive workshop format.
